Título: May your memory be a blessing

06/09/2024 • original
Filthy creatures are us humans, self-destructive masters of death.
Out of consciousness, we forge tumorous wrath.
Sensibility dims as fellows perish in the name of terror hymns,
and the yellow ribbon gloomily dyes black as hope becomes slack.

Hersh, may your curiosity preach for unity.
Carmel, may your mindfulness enlighten hopelessness.
Eden, may your beauty remind us of our duty.
Alex, may your selflessness save many in the glimpse of a fatal destiny.
Almog, may your celestial chords resemble the Levite's carol.
Ori, may your ambition serve as ammunition for the love coalition.

On the verge of abandonment,
the time has come for an amendment.

Bring them home now!
