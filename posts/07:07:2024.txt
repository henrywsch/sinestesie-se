Título: UNTITLED LOVE STORY, FROM A BOY WHO HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ONE

07/07/2024 • original
	Sure, love stories are cute. But I never understood the lovers’ ecstasy on hot make-out scenes, neither such excessively dramatic and slowly-paced background songs’ significance. The man’s urgency and the chick’s moaning seemed weird. Why on earth couldn’t them wait to spice things up in a place other than the elevator? Was the risk of bumping into nosy neighbors worth it? Well, it didn’t for me, or at least to thirteen-year-old me. Thirteen-year-old me would last to see things as I do now. Besides my teenage years, it would also take tears, sleepless nights, unrequited crushes, suicidal thoughts, and faith crises. Among what remained, there it was my childish long-lasting dream of becoming a novelist.
	I was indeed sometimes told I had a thing for words, but, as a proper procrastinator, none of my sci-fi stories, fan-fictions or comic books made it through first draft. Understanding myself felt like unlocking whole new levels, as one does on videogames. Besides dungeons & dragons, however, I unlocked sensations and desires. Suddenly the magic of love songs and hot scenes made sense, and the so-said weird urgency became comprehensible. Love became accessible as I deciphered affection, so as romance became a hot-topic. This is, therefore, the mere transcription of a romance-less boy’s fantasies, based solely on his own imagination, besides actual experience. This is an untitled love story, from a boy who has never experienced one.
