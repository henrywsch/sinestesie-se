Título: We want to be everything

03/03/2024 • original
	I once heard that “in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”. Some might say that death is exactly what makes life valuable, but I don’t think that’s an absolute truth. As I check my phone and realize it’s already late, that feeling of anxiety creeps inside of me, telling me I once again did nothing from the precious time I was granted. It’s already late, and I haven’t read that book, written that article, watched that movie, or seen that friend.
	The problem is we want to be everything, and know, discover, learn, and experience it all. I want to study literature, film, and philosophy, to become a poet, a filmmaker, and a thinker. I want to visit everywhere and meet everyone. I want to watch every movie, read every book, and visit every tourist sight. We want so much, yet we have so little time. Hopefully, one hundred and twenty years, say the bible's believers. We have so little time, yet so many distractions; so many posts to like, so many people to please and so many worthless things to overthink about. It’s already late, and all I’ve done is scroll, please, and overthink.
	Who knows what will happen when the time does come? Does the aftermath include the so-promised world-to-come? Was I good enough to deserve it? So many unanswered questions, and yet there is nothing we can do about it. It’s already late, but before I call it a day, I still have time to make today worth it. I still have time to further read that book, watch that long-watchlisted movie, and call that friend. Day after day some progress is made and, even with baby steps, there’s always something to look back to and something to look forward to.
