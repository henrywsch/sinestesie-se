Título: A ‘code-based’ leader in the Western Domain
02/03/2023 • original

It's 5:03':14'' a.m., and the communal wake-up call has just rung. Both street and house lights were abruptly turned on in a blinding glare. I take my flavorless breakfast pills, life in the Western Domain ain't easy. Since AI took place, pleasure is a memory, and creativity is summed up on Phyton5001 codes. I take my diary, an ancient form of the forgotten art of writing. There is a total of 7 minutes and 54 seconds until my shift starts, time supposed to be dedicated to personal hygiene, but which I exchanged for journaling for the sake of my sanity. As long as I present myself in time for roll-call, nothing will happen.

Western Domain, October 5th, 2041
	Today is the Empire’s 18th birthday; I woke up dying for some French toast-flavored breakfast pills. It has been 6570 days since the last piece of red meat I had. It has also been 6570 days since this journal's first entry. Such a milestone deserves remembrance.

I stop writing; there is absolutely no interesting matter deserving to be registered, despite something that recalls the past. Also, no news from the Eastern Domain. The only future event in all Western is the senator's public euthanization for attempting to turn off the AI's main server, taking place at 6:42':35'' p.m. on November 15th. It is better to revisit this journal's first entry.

	America has fallen; the last remaining nation to be annexed into the Western Domain. It is hard to believe that so much has changed in 24 hours. The world is from now on divided into Western and Eastern Domains with headquarters in Luxembourg and Kuwait respectively, both led by the rules of ruthless artificial intelligence devices, aka AI.
	They've warned us, but daily threats from Luxembourg's ecosystem weren't enough. In an attempt to eradicate corruption from civilization, world leaders trusted their nations' power on their respective nationally developed AI technologies. Even America's ALEXA, Russia's IVAN, and China's MAO weren't enough to defeat Luxembourg's' EVA and Kuwait's ALI.
	Now all humankind is segregated in its domain, iron-handedly led by AI ignorant towards empathy and ethics. Every decision is efficiently and precisely taken, and deciding between saving a thousand pets' or a baby's life is easy. Now, a single delay to work may potentially be punished from a fee to death, depending on whether it was a 5'' or 30'' delay. For an artificial and code-based dictator, no moral guidelines matter. What it judges as correct is accurately and ruthlessly implemented with no misses, to every single human being regardless of race or ethnicity, being exactly what makes it even more powerful and dangerous than the Nazi's 3rd Reich.
