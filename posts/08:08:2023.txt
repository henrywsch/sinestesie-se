Título: What new dimensions of storytelling does film provide in comparison to prose?

08/08/2023 • original
	Myth or not, an actual audience stampede is associated with the showcase of what is considered to be the first movie ever; Louis and August Lumière's most famous “Actualité” Arrivée d'un train à la Ciotat (1895). Taking into account either effect, moral, imagination, or plot development, motion pictures provide whole new dimensions of storytelling, especially in comparison to its direct relative; prose. In fact, films were not the first media type responsible for generating emotions. As early as when books became popular, the 'jaw dropped' or 'I've been cheated' reaction motivated readers to reread a book's last page multiple times in repeat or to simply throw it through the window.
	Looking at the definition of “stampede” as “a sudden frightened rush”, films may be seen as agents of much deeper versions of such emotions, therefore as of enhanced effect on the audience; especially in the onset of movies as entertainment forms. From a prose's range of potential desired effects, the successful establishment of identification acts as a game changer in establishing a work as a bestseller. A legendary Brazilian classic from Machado de Assis; Dom Casmurro (1899), is recognized as an agent of identification with the slaveholder upper class of Rio de Janeiro in XIX.
	As movies acted as agents of enhanced effect, they consequently exponentially enhanced identification, commonly for minorities and the poorest, as they traditionally present fair visual representations of diverse fictitious characters. Initially mute, motion pictures, therefore, became popular among the lower social classes, adopted as a preferential entertainment form by incoming immigrants due to the absence of language barriers. The biggest bet for Brazil in the Oscars 2023 qualifications, Marte Um (2022), acts as an exemplary role model, featuring black, dwarf, and LGBTQIA+ characters in positive social positions. The representation of popular day life and diversity in such vivid visual forms, as done by motion pictures, makes identification enormous and accessible for people other than members of the higher classes.
	In addition to events constituting a plot's rising action, multiple storytelling aspects, exclusive to film, define the transition between each stage of a movie's development, as the soundtrack. The first motion picture in history to “talk to its audience” was Warner Brothers' The Jazz Singer (1927), whose sound was produced through the newly patented “Vitaphone”. Among its various utilities in cinema, soundtrack acts to immerse the audience into a plot's happenings and indicate incoming action, therefore defining the transition of plot development stages, as between rising action, climax, and falling action. The iconic theme song of Mission Impossible (1996) defines the movie's transition towards its climax, as watchers expect action as the jingle begins. As no sound is featured in text, rather than a simple representation as onomatopoeia, a prose's storytelling must rely on literary and rhetorical devices only to define transition, in contrast to film containing a range of options.
	As the seventh art includes a combination of others, such as writing, photography, and music, their combination provides cinema with either entirely new (soundtrack) or adapted (effect) dimensions of storytelling, in comparison to prose. Exposing inspiring and essential stories, in clear and breathtaking ways, becomes a much easier task as filmmakers may choose from a wide range of techniques and practices.
